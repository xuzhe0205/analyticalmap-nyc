This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### Prerequisites/dependencies installation

`yarn add react-app-rewired --save-dev` or `npm install react-app-rewired --save-dev`

`yarn add customize-cra --dev` or `npm install customize-cra --dev`

### In the project directory, you can run the following code to start the web app:

`npm start` or `yarn start`

<b>Runs the app</b> in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

`npm run eject` or `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Comments and future improvement

Due to time constraint, even though the funcitonalities of this web app are included in this repository as it is, there are many aspects of information that are going to be touched on and developed in the future.

* Targeting and serving various industries: advertisement, retail, and real estate, this web app will include rich information about demographics, local housing, regional economy, net income, safety issues, events et cetera using `NYPD` and `Evenbrite` API. These data can help the public and associated industries to make informed decisions and broad knowledge about the NYC.
